VSCode: Debug => Add Configuration...=> (select Node.js)

This will create a new file: launch.json in .vscode folder, then edit it like below:

(Remember to install nodemon globally)

Note: we can use debug console like chrome console to run code to see the variable value

We can also manipulate the value through VSCode => View => Debug
